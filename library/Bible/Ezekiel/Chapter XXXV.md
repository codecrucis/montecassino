1. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2. Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
3 and say to it, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and will make thee a waste, and thou shalt be made desolate.
4 And I will cause desolation in thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
5 Because thou hast been a perpetual enemy, and hast laid wait craftily for the house of Israel, with the hand of enemies with a sword, in the time of injustice, at the last:
6 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, verily thou hast sinned even to blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.
7 And I will make mount Seir a waste, and desolate, and I will destroy from off it men and cattle:
8 and I will fill thy hills and thy valleys with slain men, and in all thy plains there shall fall in thee men slain with the sword.
9 I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited any more: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
10 Because thou saidst, The two nations and the two countries shall be mine, and I shall inherit them; whereas the Lord is there:
11 therefore, I live, saith the Lord, I will even deal with thee according to thine enmity, and I will be made known to thee when I shall judge thee:
12 and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. I have heard the voice of thy blasphemies, whereas thou hast said, The desert mountains of Israel are given to us for food;
13 and thou hast spoken swelling words against me with thy mouth: I have heard .
14 Thus saith the Lord; When all the earth is rejoicing, I will make thee desert.
15 Thou shalt be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall be utterly consumed: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord their God.
