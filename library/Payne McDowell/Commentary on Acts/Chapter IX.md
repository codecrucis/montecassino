32. And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 
33. And there he found a certain man named Æneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. 
34. And Peter said unto him, Æneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. 
35. And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord. Here we have,

1. The visit Peter made to the churches that were newly planted by the dispersed preachers, v. 32. 1. He passed through all quarters. As an apostle, he was not to be the resident pastor of any one church, but the itinerant visitor of many churches, to confirm the doctrine of inferior preachers, to confer the Holy Ghost on those that believed, and to ordain ministers. He passed dia panton—among them all, who pertained to the churches of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, mentioned in the foregoing chapter. He was, like his Master, always upon the remove, and went about doing good; but still his head-quarters were at Jerusalem, for there we shall find him imprisoned, ch. xii. 2. He came to the saints at Lydda. This seems to be the same with Lod, a city in the tribe of Benjamin, mentioned 1 Chron. viii. 12; Ezra ii. 33. The Christians are called saints, not only some particular eminent ones, as saint Peter and saint Paul, but every sincere professor of the faith of Christ. These are the saints on the earth, Ps. xvi. 3. The cure Peter wrought on Eneas, a man that had been bedridden eight years, v. 33.
2. His case was very deplorable: He was sick of the palsy, a dumb palsy, perhaps a dead palsy.
The disease was extreme, for he kept his bed; it was inveterate, for he kept his bed eight years;
and we may suppose that both he himself and all about him despaired of relief for him, and
concluded upon no other than that he must still keep his bed till he removed to his grave.
213
Chapter IX
Christ chose such patients as this, whose disease was incurable in a course of nature, to show
how desperate the case of fallen mankind was when he undertook their cure. When we were
without strength, as this poor man, he sent his word to heal us. 2. His cure was very admirable,
v. 34. (1.) Peter interested Christ in his case, and engaged him for his relief: Eneas, Jesus
Christ maketh thee whole. Peter does not pretend to do it himself by any power of his own,
but declares it to be Christ's act and deed, directs him to look up to Christ for help, and as-
sures him of an immediate cure—not, "He will make thee," but, "He does make thee, whole;"
and a perfect cure—not, "He makes thee easy," but "He makes thee whole." He does not express
himself by way of prayer to Christ that he would make him whole, but as one having authority
from Christ, and that knew his mind, he declares him made whole. (2.) He ordered him to
bestir himself, to exert himself: "Arise and make thy bed, that all may see thou art thoroughly
cured." Let none say that because it is Christ that by the power of his grace works all our
works in us therefore we have no work, no duty, to do; for, though Jesus Christ makes thee
whole, yet thou must arise and make use of the power he gives thee: "Arise, and make thy
bed, to be to thee no longer a bed of sickness, but a bed of rest." (3.) Power went along with
this word: he arose immediately, and no doubt very willingly made his own bed.
III. The good influence this had upon many (v. 35): All that dwelt at Lydda and Saron
saw him, and turned to the Lord. We can scarcely think that every individual person in those
countries took cognizance of the miracle, and was wrought upon by it; but many, the gener-
ality of the people in the town of Lydda and in the country of Saron, or Sharon, a fruitful
plain or valley, of which it was foretold, Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, Isa. lxv. 10. 1. They
all made enquiry into the truth of the miracle, did not overlook it, but saw him that was
healed, and saw that it was a miraculous cure that was wrought upon him by the power of
Christ, in his name, and with a design to confirm and ratify that doctrine of Christ which
was now preached to the world. 2. They all submitted to the convincing proof and evidence
there was in this of the divine origin of the Christian doctrine, and turned to the Lord, to
the Lord Jesus. They turned from Judaism to Christianity; they embraced the doctrine of
Christ, and submitted to his ordinances, and turned themselves over to him to be ruled and
taught and saved by him.
Tabitha Raised to Life.
36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation
is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did. 37 And
it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they
laid her in an upper chamber. 38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the dis-
ciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he
would not delay to come to them. 39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was
come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping,
and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 40 But
214
Chapter IX
Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said,
Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 41 And he
gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows,
presented her alive. 42 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the
Lord. 43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
Here we have another miracle wrought by Peter, for the confirming of the gospel, and
which exceeded the former—the raising of Tabitha to life when she had been for some time
dead. Here is,
I. The life, and death, and character of Tabitha, on whom this miracle was wrought, v.
36, 37. 1. She lived at Joppa, a sea-port town in the tribe of Dan, where Jonah took shipping
to go to Tarshish, now called Japho. 2. Her name was Tabitha, a Hebrew name, the Greek
for which is Dorcas, both signifying a doe, or hind, or deer, a pleasant creature. Naphtali is
compared to a hind let loose, giving goodly words; and the wife to the kind and tender husband
is as the loving hind, and as the pleasant roe, Prov. v. 19. 3. She was a disciple, one that had
embraced the faith of Christ and was baptized; and not only so, but was eminent above
many for works of charity. She showed her faith by her works, her good works, which she
was full of, that is, in which she abounded. Her head was full of cares and contrivances which
way she should do good. She devised liberal things, Isa. xxxii. 8. Her hands were full of good
employment; she made a business of doing good, was never idle, having learned to maintain
good works (Tit. iii. 8), to keep up a constant course and method of them. She was full of
good works, as a tree that is full of fruit. Many are full of good words, who are empty and
barren in good works; but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker: Non magna loquimur,
sed vivimus—We do not talk great things, but we live them. Among other good works, she
was remarkable for her alms—deeds, which she did, not only her works of piety, which are
good works and the fruits of faith, but works of charity and beneficence, flowing from love
to her neighbour and a holy contempt of this world. Observe, She is commended not only
for the alms which she gave, but for the alms—deeds which she did. Those that have not
estates wherewith to give in charity may yet be able to do in charity, working with their
hands, or walking with their feet, for the benefit of the poor. And those who will not do a
charitable deed, whatever they may pretend, if they were rich would not bestow a charitable
gift. She was full of alms—deeds, hon epoiei—which she made; there is an emphasis upon
her doing them, because what her hand found to do of this kind she did with all her might,
and persevered in. They were alms—deeds, not which she purposed and designed and said
she would do, but which she did; not which she began to do, but which she did, which she
went through with, which she performed the doing of, 2 Cor. viii. 11; ix. 7. This is the life
and character of a certain disciple,; and should be of all the disciples of Christ; for, if we thus
bear much fruit, then are we his disciples indeed, John xv. 8. 4. She was removed in the
midst of her usefulness (v. 37): In those days she fell sick, and died. It is promised to those
215
Chapter IX
who consider the poor, not that they shall never be sick, but that the Lord will strengthen
them upon the bed of languishing, at least with strength in their souls, and so will make all
their bed in their sickness, will make it easy, Ps. xli. 1, 3. They cannot hope that they shall
never die (merciful men are taken away, and merciful women too, witness Tabitha), but
they may hope that they shall find mercy of the Lord in that day, 2 Tim. i. 18. 5. Her friends
and those about her did not presently bury her, as usual, because they were in hopes Peter
would come and raise her to life again; but they washed the dead body, according to the
custom, which, it is said, was with warm water, which, if there were any life remaining in
the body, would recover it; so that this was done to show that she was really and truly dead.
They tried all the usual methods to bring her to life, and could not. Conclamatum est—the
last cry was uttered. They laid her out in her grave-clothes in an upper chamber, which Dr.
Lightfoot thinks was probably the public meeting-room for the believers of that town; and
they laid the body there, that Peter, if he would come, might raise her to life the more sol-
emnly in that place.
II. The request which her Christian friends sent to Peter to come to them with all speed,
not to attend the funeral, but, if it might be, to prevent it, v. 38. Lydda, where Peter now
was, was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples at Joppa had heard that Peter was there, and that
he had raised Eneas from a bed of languishing; and therefore they sent him two men, to
make the message the more solemn and respectful, desiring him that he would not delay to
come to them; not telling him the occasion, lest he should modestly decline coming upon
so great an errand as to raise the dead: if they can but get him to them, they will leave it to
him. Their friend was dead, and it was too late to send for a physician, but not too late to
send for Peter. Post mortem medicus—a physician after death, is an absurdity, but not Post
mortem apostolus—an apostle after death.
III. The posture in which he found the survivors, when he came to them (v. 30): Peter
arose and went with them. Though they did not tell him what they wanted him for, yet he
was willing to go along with them, believing it was upon some good account or other that
he was sent for. Let not faithful ministers grudge to be at every body's beck, as far as they
have ability, when the great apostle made himself the servant of all, 1 Cor. ix. 19. He found
the corpse laid in the upper chamber, and attended by widows, probably such as were in
the communion of the church, poor widows; there they were,
3. Commending the deceased—a good work, when there was that in them which was
truly commendable, and worthy of imitation, and when it is done modestly and soberly,
and without flattery of the survivors or any sinister intention, but purely for the glory of
God and the exciting of others to that which is virtuous and praiseworthy. The commendation
of Tabitha was like her own virtues, not in word, but in deed. Here were no encomiums of
her in orations, nor poems inscribed to her memory; but the widows showed the coats and
garments which she made for them, and bestowed upon them while she was with them. It
216
Chapter IX
was the comfort of Job, while he lived, that the loins of the poor blessed him, because they
were warmed with the fleece of his sheep, Job xxxi. 20. And here it was the credit of Tabitha,
when she was dead, that the backs of the widows praised her for the garments which she
made them. And those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them in the gates,
whether the words of others do or no. It is much more honourable to clothe a company of
decrepit widows with needful clothing for night and day, who will pray for their benefactors
when they do not see them, than to clothe a company of lazy footmen with rich liveries,
who perhaps behind their backs will curse those that clothe them (Eccl. vii. 21); and it is
what all that are wise and good will take a greater pleasure in, for goodness is true greatness,
and will pass better in the account shortly. Observe, (1.) Into what channel Tabitha turned
much of her charity. Doubtless there were other instances of her alms—deeds which she
did, but this was now produced; she did, as it should seem with her own hands, make coats
and garments for poor widows, who perhaps with their own labour could make a shift to
get their bread, but could not earn enough to buy clothes. And this is an excellent piece of
charity, If thou seest the naked, that thou cover him (Isa. lviii. 7), and not think it enough to
say, Be ye warmed, James ii. 15, 16. (2.) What a grateful sense the poor had of her kindness:
They showed the coats, not ashamed to own that they were indebted to her for the clothes
on their backs. Those are horribly ungrateful indeed who have kindness shown them and
will not make at least an acknowledgment of it, by showing the kindness that is done them,
as these widows here did. Those who receive alms are not obliged so industriously to conceal
it, as those are who give alms. When the poor reflect upon the rich as uncharitable and un-
merciful, they ought to reflect upon themselves, and consider whether they are not unthankful
and ungrateful. Their showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made tended to the
praise not only of her charity, but of her industry, according to the character of the virtuous
woman, that she lays her hands to the spindle, or at least to the needle, and then stretches
out her hand to the poor, and reaches forth her hands to the needy, of what she has worked;
and, when God and the poor have thus had their due, she makes herself coverings of tapestry
and her own clothing is silk and purple, Prov. xxxi. 19-22.
4. They were here lamenting the loss of her: The widows stood by Peter, weeping. When
the merciful are taken away, it should be laid to heart, especially by those to whom they
have been in a particular manner merciful. They need not weep for her; she is taken from
the evil to come, she rests from her labours and her works follow her, besides those she leaves
behind her: but they weep for themselves and for their children, who will soon find the want
of such a good woman, that has not left her fellow. Observe, They take notice of what good
Dorcas did while she was with them, but now she is gone from them, and this is their grief.
Those that are charitable will find that the poor they have always with them; but it is well if
those that are poor find that they have always the charitable with them. We must make a
good use of the lights that yet a little while are with us, because they will not be always with
217
Chapter IX
us, will not be long with us: and when they are gone we shall think what they did when they
were with us. It should seem, the widows wept before Peter, as an inducement to him, if he
could do any thing, to have compassion on them and help them, and restore one to them
that used to have compassion on them. When charitable people are dead, there is no praying
them to life again; but, when they are sick, this piece of gratitude is owing to them, to pray
for their recovery, that, if it be the will of God, those may be spared to live who can ill be
spared to die.
IV. The manner in which she was raised to life. 1. Privately: She was laid in the upper
room where they used to have their public meetings, and, it should seem, there was great
crowding about the dead body, in expectation of what would be done; but Peter put them
all forth, all the weeping widows, all but some few relations of the family, or perhaps the
heads of the church, to join with him in prayer; as Christ did, Matt. ix. 25. Thus Peter declined
every thing that looked like vainglory and ostentation; they came to see, but he did not come
to be seen. He put them all forth, that he might with the more freedom pour out his soul
before God in prayer upon this occasion, and not be disturbed with their noisy and clamorous
lamentations. 2. By prayer. In his healing Eneas there was an implied prayer, but in this
greater work he addressed himself to God by solemn prayer, as Christ when he raised Lazarus;
but Christ's prayer was with the authority of a Son, who quickens whom he will; Peter's with
the submission of a servant, who is under direction, and therefore he knelt down and prayed.
5. By the word, a quickening word, a word which is spirit and life: He turned to the body,
which intimates that when he prayed he turned from it; lest the sight of it should discourage
his faith, he looked another way, to teach us, like Abraham, against hope, to believe in hope,
and overlook the difficulties that lie in the way, not considering the body as now dead, lest
we should stagger at the promise, Rom. iv. 19, 20. But, when he had prayed, he turned to the
body, and spoke in his Master's name, according to his example: "Tabitha, arise; return to
life again." Power went along with this word, and she came to life, opened her eyes which
death had closed. Thus, in the raising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is
the opening of the eyes of the mind, ch. xxvi. 18. When she saw Peter, she sat up, to show
that she was really and truly alive; and (v. 41) he gave her his hand and lifted her up, not as
if she laboured under any remaining weakness, but thus he would as it were welcome her
to life again, and give her the right hand of fellowship among the living, from whom she
had been cut off. And, lastly, he called the saints and widows, who were all in sorrow for her
death, and presented her alive to them, to their great comfort, particularly of the widows,
who laid her death much to heart (v. 41); to them he presented her, as Elijah (1 Kings xvii.
23), and Elisha (2 Kings iv. 36), and Christ (Luke vii. 15), presented the dead sons alive to
their mothers. The greatest joy and satisfaction are expressed by life from the dead.
V. The good effect of this miracle. 1. Many were by it convinced of the truth of the
gospel, that is was from heaven, and not of men, and believed in the Lord, v. 42. The thing
218
Chapter IX
was known throughout all Joppa; it would be in every body's mouth quickly, and, it being a
town of seafaring men, the notice of it would be the sooner carried thence to other countries,
and though some never minded it many were wrought upon by it. This was the design of
miracles, to confirm a divine revelation. 2. Peter was hereby induced to continue some time
in this city, v. 43. Finding that a door of opportunity was opened for him there, he tarried
there many days, till he was sent thence, and sent for thence upon business to another place.
He tarried not in the house of Tabitha, though she was rich, lest he should seem to seek his
own glory; but he took up his lodgings with one Simon a tanner, an ordinary tradesman,
which is an instance of his condescension and humility: and hereby he has taught us not to
mind high things, but to condescend to those of low estate, Rom. xii. 16. And, though Peter
might seem to be buried in obscurity here in the house of a poor tanner by the sea-side, yet
hence God fetched him to a noble piece of service, which is recorded in the next chapter;
for those that humble themselves shall be exalted.
