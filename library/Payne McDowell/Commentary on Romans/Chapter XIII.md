Be Subject to Government


1. Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. 
2. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. 
3. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; 
4. for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. 
5. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience’ sake. 
6. For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. 
7. Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.   
8. Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. 
9. For this, “YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY, YOU SHALL NOT MURDER, YOU SHALL NOT STEAL, YOU SHALL NOT COVET,” and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, “YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.” 
10. Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.   
11. Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed. 
12. The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 
13. Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and jealousy. 
14. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.



"every person"
- does Paul really mean "every person" or is he meaning "every Christian" or "every saint in Rome" or "every person who reads this letter"? And if he means "every person", Christian or not, then what do we do with this? There is much talk in the year of our Lord 2025 that Christians should not be legalistic among its own ranks, and certainly should not impose their own Christian morality on others (that is, particularly in an American context which worships, above all else, an ostensible secular neutrality in the public square). Why is there, or would there be, outrage when a Christian would say, with conviction, "a Christian should observe the Sabbath and thus not become a professional NFL player", "women should dress modestly", "a man should be the head of his wife and she should obey him", etc. but then again there is no such outrage if we say "you should obey the government even on matters beyond its given given authority" (e.g. COVID mask mandates)? Evangelicals would have a conniption if a husband exercised authority or leadership even an inch outside of the approved "servant servantship" boundaries, shouting that "he ain't God" (even though the Holy Bible commands a husband to be the head anda the wife to obey) but no such outrage if a government makes laws beyond "a terror to evil conduct" or worse yet, becomes a terror to good conduct.
- does "every person" include Dietrich Bonhoeffer? Should he have been subject to the Third Reich?

"be in subjection"
- What is the scope of subjection? Where does it begin and end? Is the government's authority total with the exception of direct contradictions to God's laws? If the government forbids that a church gather to worship God on a Sunday morning (for means of social distancing and flattening the curve of COVID) can/should/must a Christian disobey? Or must a Christian be in subjection because we have livestreaming technology now that the author of Hebrews didn't have? If there is a "minimum barrier to entry" (in other words, a rejection of petty tyranical involvement in the smaller things of life) what is it? Do we say "a government is illegitimate expect when it is a terror to evil conduct but we disobey every command which is a terror to good conduct"?
- How does that subjection to government relate to the Christian's subjection to God? A wife's subjection to her husband? A layman's subjection to his elders? What are the scope, beginning and end, categories, order of authorities? A child's subjection to her parents? We might say that it's easy to place God at the tope of the hierarchy, but what next? If government, elder, husband, and parent give 4 different and incompatible instructions to a woman/wife/mother, how does she triage the instructions? And can she wash her hands clean, have a clean conscious, if in obeying one authority instituted by God she must necessarily disobey a different authority instituted by God?
