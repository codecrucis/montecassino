1. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
2. Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord God; O shepherds of Israel, do shepherds feed themselves? do not the shepherds feed the sheep?
3. Behold, ye feed on the milk, and clothe yourselves with the wool, and slay the fat: but ye feed not my sheep.
4. The weak one ye have not strengthened, and the sick ye have not cherished, and the bruised ye have not bound up, and the stray one ye have not turned back, and the lost ye have not sought; and the strong ye have wearied with labour.
5. And my sheep were scattered, because there were no shepherds: and they became meat to all the wild beasts of the field.
6. And my sheep were scattered on every mountain, and on every high hill: yea, they were scattered on the face of the earth, and there was none to seek them out, nor to bring them back.
7. Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord.
8. I live, saith the Lord God, surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became meat to all the wild beasts of the field, because there were no shepherds, and the shepherds sought not out my sheep, and the shepherds fed themselves, but fed not my sheep.
9. For this cause, O shepherds,
10. thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hands, and will turn them back that they shall not feed my sheep, and the shepherds shall no longer feed them; and I will deliver my sheep out of their mouth, and they shall no longer be meat for them.
11. For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will seek out my sheep, and will visit them.
12. As the shepherd seeks his flock, in the day when there is darkness and cloud, in the midst of the sheep that are separated: so will I seek out my sheep, and will bring them back from every place where they were scattered in the day of cloud and darkness.
13. And I will bring them out from the Gentiles, and will gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land, and will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, and in the valleys, and in every inhabited place of the land.
14. I will feed them in a good pasture, on a high mountain of Israel: and their folds shall be there, and they shall lie down, and there shall they rest in perfect prosperity, and they shall feed in a fat pasture on the mountains of Israel.
15. I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to rest; and they shall know that I am the Lord: thus saith the Lord God.
16. I will seek that which is lost, and I will recover the stray one, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen the fainting, and will guard the strong, and will feed them with judgment.
17. And you, ye sheep, thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will distinguish between sheep and sheep, rams and he-goats.
18. And not enough for you that ye fed on the good pasture, that ye trampled with your feet the remnant of your pasture? and ye drank the standing water, ye disturbed the residue with your feet?
19. So my sheep fed on that which ye had trampled with your feet; and they drank the water that had been disturbed by your feet.
20. Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will separate between the strong sheep and the weak sheep.
21. Ye did thrust with your sides and shoulders, and pushed with your horns, and ye cruelly treated all the sick.
22. Therefore I will save my sheep, and they shall not be any more for a prey; and will judge between ram and ram.
23. And I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall tend them, my servant David, and he shall be their shepherd;
24. and I the Lord will be to them a God, and David a prince in the midst of them; I the Lord have spoken it.
25. And I will make with David a covenant of peace and I will utterly destroy evil beasts from off the land; and they shall dwell in the wilderness, and sleep in the forests.
26. And I will settle them round about my mountain; and I will give you the rain, the rain of blessing.
27. And the trees that are in the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her strength, and they shall dwell in the confidence of peace on their land, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have broken their yoke; and I will deliver them out of the hand of those that enslaved them.
28. And they shall no more be a spoil to the nations, and the wild beasts of the land shall no more at all devour them; and they shall dwell safely, and there shall be none to make them afraid.
29. And I will raise up for them a plant of peace, and they shall no more perish with hunger upon the land, and they shall no more bear the reproach of the nations.
30. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and they my people. O house of Israel, saith the Lord God,
31. ye are my sheep, even the sheep of my flock, and I am the Lord your God, saith the Lord God.

What is a prophet? Do prophets still exist today? What of the prophetic voice? Do we prophesy only to nonbelievers, only to believers, or both, or neither? Is a pastor the modern prophet? Are there prophet pastors and nonprophetic pastors? If so, should it be so? Should all pastors be prophets? should none? Should the distinction between OT prophets and modern pastors be this: that the OT prophets received a new word from the Lord, while modern pastors have the Holy Bible as the word of the Lord with no new revelations?
In the Holy Bible, prophets speak to believers and unbelievers alike. 

Here, Ezekiel receives a word from the Lord that is to be spoken against the shepherds of Israel. 

What is that word spoken against the shepherds of Israel? That the shepherds have left the sheep exposed, in danger, without a shepherd, the sheep became meat to all the wild beasts of the field, the shepherds have meanwhile been feeding themselves, clothing themselves, living comfortably. 

Here we see, in the prophesy, the negative which informs us of the positive: by seeing the specific reason for the criticism, we can see what the shepherds should have been doing all along. We see the "you ought to have" in the "how dare you". 
- Feed the sheep (Ezekiel 14:2, 3)
- Strengthen the weak (Ezekiel 14:4)
- Cherish the sick (Ezekiel 14:4)
- Bind up the bruised (Ezekiel 14:4)
- Turn back the stay one (Ezekiel 14:4)
- Seek the lost (Ezekiel 14:4)
- Do not weary the strong with labour (Ezekiel 14:4)
- Protect the sheep such that they don't scatter; or rather, keep the sheep together; or rather, defend the sheep from wild beasts of the field (Ezekiel 14:5, 6)
- Seek out the scattered sheep and bring them back (Ezekiel 14:6)
- So protect the sheep and so seek out the sheep and so feed the sheep that they do not become a prey, that they do not become meat to all the wild beasts of the field

Lest we become gnostic deists and think that God only works in saving souls and has no involvement in the filthy affairs of this mortal life, God promises to bring His people out from the Gentiles, to gather His people from the countries, and to bring them into their own land. (Ezekiel 14:11-16)

God can and will (or has already) distinguished between sheep and sheep, rams and he-goats. There are some that appear outwardly to be among the fold, yet are not;
