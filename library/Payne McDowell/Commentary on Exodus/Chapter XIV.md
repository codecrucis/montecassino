In the year of our Lord 2025, would we criticize, be concerned with, or otherwise doubt the sanctification/righteousness of a Christian who says what Moses said in Exodus 14:13-14? "Be of good courage: stand and see the salvation which is from the Lord, which he will work for us this day; for as ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace."
- Is this "Christian Nationalism"? Is this forgetting "No King but Christ"? Have we forsaken the mission of Christ and replaced it with a desire for political solutions?
